##### Cad é a chur tús leis an Chéideadh?
<p>
Is iad na taifid a rinne Eaglais Naomh Mata, eaglais de chuid Eaglais na
  hÉireann, an foinse is fearr eolas ar bhunús an Chéididh. Tógadh Eaglais Naomh
  Mata sa bhliain 1775. San am sin, chuaigh an bealach go Baile na Lorgan suas
  Sráid na hEaglaise, thar an eaglais féin, agus ar aghaidh fríd Meán an Bhóthair,

The greatest source of information of the origination of Keady can be had in the
records of Church of Ireland (Episcopalian) St. Mathews. It was erected in the
year 1775. The road at the time from Keady to Castleblayney was up Church St.,
past the church via the man-o-war hill in Lagan.

Is talamh seasc scéirdiúil a bhí i Lagán, agus é uilig faoi aitneach agus

Lagan was a barren land without habitation covered with whins and shrub. Keady
was supplied with water by two wells, one on Church St, behind Arthur Mone’s
land and the other in Newholland, both have long since been filled up.

The first building in Meeting St. was the Presbyterian church, erected in the
year 1803, known as the ‘meeting house’, the way to it was from Church St. from
Arthur Mone’s gateway and it was only a beaten path for walking. Probably the
next building erected was “The Shandon Bells”. It was a barrick at that time.
Then as Keady grew a most substantial building was erected in Bridge St. in the
year 1876. When it was vacated for the present Barrick, Frank Slavin bought it
and now John McKeever (Slevin’s son in law) carries on the hardware business in
it. Keady at the beginning consisted of Church St. and a few houses on Main St.
and a row in the Square. Keady town got its name from the Square, which is in
the townland of “Keady”.

The family of John Cunningham (My great grandfather) carried on a shipping trade
in their hometown Rathfriland, Co Down.  He came to Tassagh at the age of 15
years served his time to Blacksmithing, married Mary Trodden, probably at
Ballymacnab. It is thought that he and his brother came from Rathfriland in a
hurry after an fray with the police (yeomen). His brother broke a police mans
arm. At that time a deed like that was punishable with death or transportation.
His brother fled to America and John fled to Keady (a very insignificant hamlet
at the time). It is not known whether he was married at the time, but I do know
that he built himself a hut in the square and started a Blacksmith shop. He had
a wonderful knowledge of the ailments of animals and very soon became a most
respected member of the community. He prospered and bought the ground from
Samuel McCabe and his brother for three houses in what was known as Victoria St.
When he had them built he sold them and he bought another 60 ft. of frontage on
the same side of the street that is the east side. On it he built three houses.

These six houses, as a matter of fact, all that row of houses were demolished in
1965 to make way for the present street. They started to build Lir Gardens in
1967. Built by the U. D. C.

Crossmore Green (“The White City”) was built on what was known as “Carvil’s
Meadow” around the year 1950. Built by the Housing Authority.

The Catholics first worshipped in Keady at the Mass Rock in Newholland. If you
follow the river marching Patsy McCann’s land and travel along it about 30 ft.
inside John Rice’s boundary half-way up on that face of rock. The inquisite
seeker should have no difficulty in finding a flat rock specially known as Mass
Rock.

Just beside Mass Rock was one of two wells, which supplied Keady with water in
those early days. According to tradition, a gentleman (a protestant) and his
daughter were driving past in their coach. It was snowing heavily at the time
and Mass was being said. This young lady filled with compassion for the poor
Catholics begged her father to give them shelter. He gave them a barn he had. It
was situated in that part of the graveyard between Pat McParlands and Gollaghys.
While they still worshipped in the barn they built a church around it, which
served them until they built the present Church in 1860. The town hall rates
with the Church of Ireland as the oldest building in town. It was constructed
with free stone and brick. It was meant as a symbol of “Free Masonry” built in
1870.

The first protestant school (opposite the present barrick) is now derelict.
Tradition has it that one of the sub-Kings of Ireland was drowned in Clea Lough,
while crossing from Mountainy road. At the middle ramper his horse stumbled and
he was drowned in the swirling waters.  Under recent renovations to Clea Lake by
the Water Board the middle ramper is no longer visible. By the way Clea Lake is
an everlasting supply of fresh water, it is being literally covered with strong
springs. Keady was a very prosperous little town indeed until what was known as
the “Hungry Thirties”. It had three mills working for the manufacture of linen,
which gave full employment. The Kirk family were in no small way responsible for
this and the working people to show their appreciation collected the money and
erected the present monument in the middle of the town.  There has been several
attempts to have the monument removed altogether over the past 30 years. As a
matter of fact there was a pillar on each side of the present monument. They
were demolished by the Urban District Council to widen the street on each side
of it. The pillars were about 10 ft. high.

The primary reason for its removal is because the Union Jack flies above it. The
Unionists always claimed the right to fly the Union Jack on it, though where
they got it is beyond my comprehension. After all it was mostly Catholics who
paid for the erection.

What of the land surrounding Keady; well there is a vain of land, which is rich
in red soil extending from Castleshane in Co. Monaghan through Drumhillary,
Temple Crosskeys and on to Lisnadill. This is of the best quality of land for
cropping or grazing. Well draw another imaginary line a mile from this to North
of Keady and the land is of lesser quality and the soil is a bright brown in
colour but still very good land with unlimited depth of till. The further you
travel to the South the land deteriorates until you reach the mountains (“The
Brague”) when it finally peters out to nothing but bracken and inferior type
peat.

The Ball-alley at the low end of the town was erected by the parochial funds. It
never was suitable for playing because it was too short and I never remember a
serious game played on it. It has remained derelict for years. There was an
excellent Ball-alley in Derrynoose and many a great game I had on it. We had a
hand ball club – chairman myself, vice president Paddy Mone (Vet) RIP, Sec.
Kevin Arthurs and Treasurer Teddy Hughes, up to the end of the 1940”s and
because of constant badgering from Derrynoose we handed over the funds over £32
to Tommy McAnally (Sec.) with Tommie Kelly (Treasurer). That ended both
badgering and the club. In a way it was a pity because we organized some keenly
fought competitions.

Keady can also boast of probably the oldest dramatic club in County Armagh. It
dates back to 1840, to almost the beginning of Keady, but the last group after
winning numerous awards and cups are now defunct and there does not seem to be
anyone to re-organize it, more the pity.

Keady also has the honour of being the one place in Co. Armagh to have kept
hurling alive all down through the years. In this year 1965 Armagh reached the
All Ireland Jun. final after beating Waterford in the semi-final at Armagh.
Hurling now seems to be in the ascendancy ‘more power to it’. It is Ireland’s
oldest game and still the best. I can visualize a great future for it, now with
the advent of television, for which it is so suitable. What I have written is
taken from my head at random. The spelling may not be all that could be desired
(it was always one of my greatest failures). My grandfather Patrick Mone was
born at Carnagh, Keady. His mother was Sally Fegan (Genties). When his father
died, his mother and family were evicted from their farm, because the oldest
child was a girl (that was the law in existence at that time). Had the eldest
child been a boy, he would have been given tenance of the farm. The family moved
into the town of Castleblayney and Patrick came to work as a blacksmith for my
great grandfather John Cunningham and he eventually married his daughter Ellen
Cunningham who had been a keen businesswoman.

At the beginning of this century Keady was known as “The town of the Tailors”.
Smyths (owned by Lenaghs now) employed as many as 16 tailors and with Watter’s
drapery and Fegans (Teddy Hughes now) they made all clothes by hand. I can
remember my aunt Mary McCooey making as many as two dozen shirts per week in her
own home. She also attended to the shop and carried on a catering trade on Fair
days and market days (Fridays) when farmers and their wives came to the town for
their week’s provisions in the horse and cart.

Derrynoose had a protestant rector named Oliver Gray (a Planter) in 1613. That
was 140 years before Keady parish was formed at all. Then the Scotch settlers
began to move into Keady and started the linen industry because of an ample
supply of water from the river Callan and Clea Lake. They made a “catch down”
covering 2 roods of ground known as the “Bottom” just behind our house on
Victoria St. The water was piped from there to the wheel, which provided the
power for the working of machinery in the mill. The pipes were 3 ft. in diameter
(approx) and were made of light metal, like galvanized. In the 1940s my father
fought a lawsuit for ownership of this bottom and lost. Afterwards Kirk’s estate
offered it to him for the sum of £10. He refused although it must have cost him
several times that amount to fight the case.  It was afterwards sold to Keady
UDC for £50 by Charles Mallon acting for the Kirk’s estate.

The first rector of the Church of Ireland named the Rev. Dickton was severely
beaten up a short distance out of Keady on the Tassagh Road because of his
sympathy for the native Irish people.

The bells of St. Mathews and St. Patrick’s churches were purchased in Dublin and
were transported at the same time by water up the canal as far as
Blackwatertown. The Catholics and Protestants joined to bring them by horses to
Keady. Apparently they were more friendly towards each other then.

 I have always found it impossible to denote any difference in tone between the
 two bells. Has this fact a greater significance.

The townlands of Crossdened (meaning in Irish “The cross of the Holy Place”)
and Crossmore (“The Big Cross”) converge in Market St. It was around this spot
that wheat is supposed to have fallen in the form of a cross from St. Patrick’s
horse. On this spot our ancestors thought fit to erect that monstrosity known
as the “monument”.

All the houses on the East of Main St. from the mill right down to the station
were built by J. Hughes (known as “The Mayor Hughes”) and who on his death
willed them to St. Patrick’s College, Armagh. The college in turn sold them
mostly to the occupiers. J. Hughes lived where the catholic curates live now.

Keady Parochial Hall, St. Patrick's was erected in 1954 at a cost of £26,000.
Fr. McKeown was so instrumental in it’s erection that it became known among
people as “Fr. McKeown’s Hall”.

A word which prefixes different places in the townland of Clea is “Gentle”
(meaning fairies or gentle people) and it is said that the Breens of Clea were
strong, fearless men and owning land which was always associated with the
“gentle people” proceeded to dig it up with spades for cultivation. It is also
said “That their cattle and horses began to die one by one until at the end of
the year there wasn’t a four footed beast left on their farm”.

Now this might appear silly but the people in my younger days believed in the
existence of fairies. They had a host of superstitions, such as, leaving wild
May flowers on their door-steps on the eve of May morning and leaving bread and
milk on the table for the fairies. A red-haired woman was taboo altogether. I
knew my father to turn back home when going to a fair because he met a
red-haired woman. On no account must you look at a new moon through a window.
They dressed the young boys as girls to delude the fairies in case the fairies
would take the strong young boy away and leave a sickly one in his place. The
last word war seems to have put an end to all these superstitions but then the
world has advanced so much in the past 25 years that there has not been much
time for superstitions.

The Pound Bridge was demolished in 1964.

Queen Victoria was crowned in 1837 and it was partly due to her handling of
Irish affairs that brought on so much distress to the Irish people in her reign.



THE BOOK OF ARMAGH

In 1004 Armagh was visited by Brian Boru. The event is recorded in the eighth
century gospel “The Book of Armagh” as is his gift to the church of 20 ounces of
gold. He commended “My soul to God and my body to Armagh” and on his death in
1014 at the battle of Clontarf his remains were brought to Armagh and buried at
the Church of Ireland cathedral.

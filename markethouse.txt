La Salle Brothers in 1896.

The Town Hall or at it was affectionately know “The Market House” was built in
1870 under the rule of the Town Commissioners. It is a pity that so many of the
younger generation will not remember it for it was certainly an imposing
structure for a small town. Several photographs of it are still about and in the
Linenhall Library in Belfast in a book about notable buildings; there is a very
good photograph and a note about its type of architecture. Apparently it had a
Dutch flavour and was the tipical Markthaws. The Monument was built in (unk.) to
honour the memory of William Kirk who was M.P. for the area and the outstanding
linen manufacturer in the district.
